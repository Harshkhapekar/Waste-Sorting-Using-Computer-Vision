## Introduction

Waste management is a critical challenge faced by modern society. This project leverages computer vision techniques to automate the process of sorting waste into categories such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, and organic matter. The system uses machine learning models to classify waste images and sort them into the appropriate bins.
